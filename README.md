# Fourier-Phase-Neural-Network
Python code (tested on 2.7) for phase and fourier neural network in distrbution regression, regression or classification problems implemented in TensorFlow. Some part of this code was adapted from https://github.com/oxmlcs/kerpy.

The method is described in:

Testing and Learning on Distributions with Symmetric Noise Invariance (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07596)

The code tutorial_dr_aerosol.py demonstrate the use of the phase and fourier neural network on distributional regression with the MISR1 aerosol dataset. The code tutotial_toy.py demonstrates the use of the fourier neural network on a toy classification problem. 

The MISR1 dataset can be found in MISR1.mat here or at http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~vucetic/MIR.html.
