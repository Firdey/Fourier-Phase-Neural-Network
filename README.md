# Fourier-Phase-Neural-Network
Python code (tested on 2.7) for phase and fourier neural network in distribution regression or classification problems implemented in TensorFlow. Some part of this code was adapted from https://github.com/oxmlcs/kerpy.

The method is described in:

Testing and Learning on Distributions with Symmetric Noise Invariance (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07596)

The code tutorial_dr_aerosol.py demonstrates the use of the phase and fourier neural network on distribution regression applied to the MISR1 aerosol dataset. The code tutorial_toy.py demonstrates the use of the fourier neural network on a toy classification problem. 

The MISR1 dataset can be found in MISR1.mat here or at http://www.dabi.temple.edu/~vucetic/MIR.html.
